# Mmuso's Porfolio
## About
- 👋 Hi, I’m @MmusoThage
- 👀 I’m interested in python, SQL, Data Science, Mathematics and Applied Mathematics 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything and anything Data Science, Applied Math and Math

I have a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Sciences, majoring in Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics because of this I have developed a strong foundation in Mathematics and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to use and bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as a data specialist.

During my studies, I refined my ability to work with complex data and through this rigorus process developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, aswell as statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to grow expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working in a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
